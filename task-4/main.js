/*
## Task 4

ðŸ‘‰ On your HTML page, you will see an input field and an 'Add To List' button. Declare a new variable, `importantThings`, as an empty array. Using JavaScript, configure the website so that when you write something in the input field and click the `Add To List` button, a new item is added to the `importantThings` array.

ðŸ‘‰ As well as adding the item to the in memory array, now display each added item in an `li` element within the ordered list.

ðŸ‘‰ Add a new label and input field element to your `index.html` file. This input field represents the priority value of your important thing, and should take in a number. Refactor your code so that, when you click your `Add To List` button, you add an object to your array, rather than a string value. For example: `let importantThings = [{text: 'telephone mother', priority: 1}]`.

ðŸ‘‰ Add a new button to your site called `Order List`. Wh the button is clicked, reorder your list by priority.
