## Task 3

ğŸ‘‰ Create an image element on the task-3 `index.html`. Using `fetch`, get a random cat image URL using the following API: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search

ğŸ‘‰ Once you have retrieved your image URL, display the image on the page. A different picture should be displayed every time you reload the page.

ğŸ‘‰ Create a button element. Add an event listener to the button so that, when you click the button, a new image is displayed.
